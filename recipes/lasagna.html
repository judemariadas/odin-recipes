        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                15 oz.ricotta cheese
            </li>
            <li>
                1 large egg
            </li>
            <li>
                2 cups mozzarella cheese
            </li>
            <li>
                3/4 cup Parmesan cheese
            </li>
            <li>
                2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
            </li>
            <li>
                1 teaspoon Salt
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 tsp pepper
            </li>
        </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2> 
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.
            </li>
        </ol>
